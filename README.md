# Deep Learning Projects

Welcome to the `deep-learning-projects` repository! This repository hosts a collection of my deep learning projects, each demonstrating different neural network architectures and applications. Below you’ll find a brief description of each project, along with links to their individual directories.

## Projects

### [Project 1: WebScrapingAI](https://github.com/michaeldrm/webscraping-ai)
- **Description**: WebScrapingAI Bot is an AI-driven application that scrapes web content, processes the text, and enables users to engage in conversational interactions based on the extracted information.
- **Techniques Used**: BeautifulSoup, text splitting with RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter, vector storage with FAISS, and conversational AI with LLM OpenAI’s GPT-3.5-turbo. It integrates these components to create a conversational agent capable of answering questions about the scraped website content.

### [Project 2: Facial Recognition](https://github.com/michaeldrm/facial-recognition)
- **Description**: Brief description of the project.
- **Techniques Used**: Techniques and neural network architectures used
- **Dataset**: Description of the dataset used

### [Project 3: Project Name](./project3)
- **Description**: Brief description of the project.
- **Techniques Used**: Techniques and neural network architectures used
- **Dataset**: Description of the dataset used
